## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#4285F4) to convey trust and competence, reflecting the academic nature of the platform.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5) for a clean and neutral learning environment.
- Accent color: Warm orange (#FFA000) to highlight important calls to action and interactive elements.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headings and short text blocks; pairing with 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for longer body text will make the app more pleasant to read. Both complement a geometric, friendly but efficient design.
- Use clean and professional icons, such as Material Design icons, for navigation and key actions.
- Employ a clean, modern layout with clear visual hierarchy to prioritize content and guide users efficiently. Consider spacing, alignment, and contrast for optimal readability and engagement.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to enhance the user experience, like fade-in effects for content loading or a smooth transition for dark/light mode switching.
